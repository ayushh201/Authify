## Authify

This project is a MERN stack authentication system that allows users to register and log in securely. User verification is done via OTP sent to their email using Mailtrap, ensuring authenticity. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, while the frontend uses React. MongoDB is used for storing user data securely.
